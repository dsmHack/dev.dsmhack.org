Congratulations! You've selected your nonprofit project and are ready to get started. Before you crack open your IDE and dive into the code, the first few hours of the jam are most well spent building a deep understanding of the problem your nonprofit is trying to solve. By doing this well, you will have a better defined path for the next 40+ hours. You may also discover unexpected solutions that your nonprofit didn't even know to ask for. After all, they are experts in serving their communities, not the nuances of the latest and greatest technology.

## Interviewing Your Nonprofit



### Take (Post It) Notes
A lot is about to be said in the next hour. You cannot possibly remember it all. You also don't know enough yet to understand how what they are saying this moment connects to an insight you'll have in two hours. You could do this in a notebook or shared document, like your probably used to for school, or you could try something a bit different.

PostIt Notes have become almost [synonymous with brainstorming & creativity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/post-it-in-ux/) for good reason. They are flexible, tangible, collaborative, and low tech. By taking notes on PostIts, you can quickly connect and organize ideas in a way that both your team and nonprofits can quickly see and contribute to. Jot one idea per note. Come up with a loose color coding (like blue for notes, yellow for ideas, red for pain points, or you're fine just sticking to one color if it is too much to keep track of). Don't worry too much about organizing them at first. You can start by putting them randomly on a wall or even a table. Once the ideas are out there, you can start grouping them. Stick related notes to one another so you can move the group all together.

### Active & Open Listening
The focus of this time is to hear what they have to say, not to try to push your own solution or ideas (wait for it, that can come later). By using [active listening](https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm) and open interview questions, you'll get much richer information.
- **Pay attention.** This is not the time to be multi-tasking on your phone.
- **Repeat, reframe & summarize what you're hearing.** "So you're saying it would be helpful to... Did I get that right?"
- **Ask questions to clarify & get below the surface.** "What do you mean when you say..." "I heard you say... Tell me more about that."
- **Let them talk.** Try to avoid talking much beyond your questions. Don't interrupt and be ok with some silence after your questions.
- **Dig into the why.** Anytime they veer into proposing solutions, dig deeper. "You say you need an app. Why?" "Tell me more about how X would change things." The technique of ["5 Whys"](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm) can surface an underlying need that may have simpler solutions than what they realize.
- **Start broad, get more specific.**
- **Ask for examples.** Get specific. "The last time" or "the worst time" is usually much more detailed than the general average version of the story.

### Example Interview Questions
- **How did you come to work at this nonprofit?**
- **What is your nonprofit's mission? What is its business model?**
- **How do you measure your success?**
- **What keeps you up at night? Why?**
- **Tell us about the community you serve.**
- **How does your nonprofit relate to other branches/regions?** (If they are part of a larger organization.)
- **How did you come up with your idea?**
- **How does this solution work today? How much time/money does it usually take?**
- **Do you expect this problem to improve, worsen or stay the same in the upcoming year? Why?**
- **What is the most frustrating thing about your current solution?**
- **What do you like/works well in the current solution?**
- **Tell me about the last time not having this project caused problems.**
- **What other solutions to this problem have you tried? What worked/didn't work?**
- **Are there other challenges you encounter when doing _____?**
- **What makes this challenge unique? Is this challenge faced by other branches/nonprofits?**
- **If others have similar problems, what do you like/not like about their solutions?**
- **How does this problem impact your staff, donors, volunteers, and community?**
- **What would it look like if this project was wildly successful?**
- **What would happen if nothing changed?**
- **What do you wish you could do that you can't do today?**
- **What challenges or curve balls do you think we might hit?**


### Logistics Questions
- **How often is content for this solution changing?**
- **Do they have a brand style guide?** If they are part of a larger organization, they may have access to design colors, fonts, icons and photos that you can use to make your project accurately reflect their brand.
- **What accounts & passwords to existing systems might be necessary?** If they are asking to integrate into a current technology system, they should either create an account for you to log in or give you the credentials to log in. You'd hate to be making great progress at 2am only to be blocked by an unknown password.
- **What's the best way to contact them during the jam?** Exchange cell numbers, email addresses or whatever their preferred means of communication.
- **Do they have any budget for this project?** Ideally try to use free solutions. However, sometimes you get what you pay for and there might be a great fit for a reasonable amount of money. Understand whether that is an option or not for your group.
- **What is their plan for supporting this project after the jam?** Who is going to be maintaining the content or process you are going to work on for the next 40+ hours? Understanding this plan can help you create good handover training and maintenance documentation (a great task for a non-technical teammate).

## Understanding the Who
People are the heart of every nonprofit: staff, donors, volunteers, and the community they are serving. Each roles will likely be impacted by your project differently or use it in different ways. Ask your nonprofits who the primary targets of this solution are. If they say everyone, try to get them to rank which groups are the most important audiences.

Have them help you build simple [personas](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/user-personas/) for the main audiences. This doesn't have to be extensive or elaborate, but it will help anchor your project in the actual humans that will need to use it. You also may have multiple personas for one role if they have large enough differences. An example would be volunteers with different motivations or obstacles -- a college student volunteer might have trouble coordinating transportation vs a retiree may have trouble navigating the website.

The main things you should define for each persona:
- **Shorthand name** (could be their role or a real name)
- **Who are they** (focus on the details that make a difference)
- **What are their goals**
- **What are the current obstacles to those goals**

## Map Their Current & Ideal States
Instead of just talking about their current process, it is often helpful to see it mapped out, alongside desired ideal state. This is an example [story map](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/), from the 2019 DSMHack, mapping the process of volunteers signing up through showing up for their shift.

## Form a Problem Statement
At this point you have enough information to form your problem statement. One way of framing this is in a question:

**How might we** [Insert Problem] (*optionally add:* **so that** [Desired Outcome])**?**

### Example from 2019 DSMHack
**Original solution idea from nonprofit:** Build a volunteer rewards store.

**Reframed problem statement:** How might we encourage volunteers to volunteer again after an initial organized volunteering event?

In the initial conversations the team discovered that there were also problems with their sign up forms that made it difficult to see upcoming events. The team delivered the asked for rewards store AND improved their volunteer sign up forms to better solve the problem from multiple angles.
