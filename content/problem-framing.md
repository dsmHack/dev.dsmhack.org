Congratulations! You've selected your nonprofit project and are ready to get started. Before you crack open your IDE and dive into the code, the first few hours of the jam
are most well spent building a deep understanding of the problem your nonprofit is trying to solve. By doing this well, you will have a better defined path for the next 40+ hours. You may also discover unexpected solutions that your nonprofit didn't even know to ask for. After all, they are experts in serving their communities, not the nuances of the latest and greatest technology.

## Interviewing Your Nonprofit

### Take (Post It) Notes
A lot is about to be said in the next hour. You cannot possibly remember it all. You also don't know enough yet to understand how what they are saying this moment connects to an insight you'll have in two hours.


### Active & Open Listening

" this is a simple process of rephrasing another person’s words as a clarifying question, in order to develop more accurate understanding. After you rephrase an important point, the client has the opportunity to make corrections or clarifications. An example might look like this:

Client: “We really want our new logo to be bold and attention-grabbing.”

Designer: “So, it sounds like you want this logo to have bright, strong colors to catch the eye. Is that right?”

Client: “Well, not necessarily. I guess what I really meant is that I’d like it to stand out within our industry.”"

### Dig Into the Why

"How Will You Measure the Success of This Project?"
"If Our Work Together Could Only Achieve One Thing, What Would it Be?
"What About Your Product Currently Works Well?"
"Why Do You Need This Project to Go Ahead? Or, Why Is This Project Happening?""

### Understanding the Who



### Logistics
- **Do they have a brand style guide?** If they are part of a larger organization, they may have access to design colors, fonts, icons and photos that you can use to make your project accurately reflect their brand.
- **What accounts & passwords to existing systems might be necessary?** If they are asking to integrate into a current technology system, they should either create an account for you to log in or give you the credentials to log in. You'd hate to be making great progress at 2am only to be blocked by an unknown password.
- **What's the best way to contact them during the jam?** Exchange cell numbers, email addresses or whatever their preferred means of communication.
- **Do they have any budget for this project?** Ideally try to use free solutions. However, sometimes you get what you pay for and there might be a great fit for a reasonable amount of money. Understand whether that is an option or not for your group.
- **What is their plan for supporting this project after the jam?** Who is going to be maintaining the content or process you are going to work on for the next 40+ hours? Understanding this plan can help you create good handover training and maintenance documentation (a great task for a non-technical teammate).
